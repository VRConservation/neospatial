Qiusheng Wu interview on CNG: https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2025/08/cng-editorial-board-spotlight-qa-qiusheng-wu:

'Tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), combined with geospatial wrappers such as segment-geospatial and GeoAI, are enabling rapid experimentation in image segmentation and classification workflows.'

'...the emergence of geospatial foundation models—large, pretrained models adapted for tasks like land cover classification, change detection, and object recognition—is a major leap forward. These models, trained on vast amounts of remote sensing and environmental data, are poised to accelerate progress in GeoAI much like foundation models have inNatural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision. When integrated with cloud-native formats such as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF and GeoParquet, these models open the door to scalable, reproducible, and near-real-time geospatial analysis on a global scale.'

'A **key challenge** is interactive visualization of GeoParquet datasets in the cloud. While the GeoParquet format is excellent for efficient storage and scalable analytics, seamless browser-based visualization—especially for large and complex datasets—is still lacking. The community would benefit from tools that bridge the gap between efficient cloud storage and dynamic, map-based user interfaces for exploration and analysis.'
